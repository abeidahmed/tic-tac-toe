## What is TicTacToe?

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os/‚ÄúX‚Äôy O‚Äôsies‚Äù (Ireland), is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. - from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)
